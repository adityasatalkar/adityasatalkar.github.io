It was only when I turned twelve, I attended an introductory session at school on Microsoft’s ‘Frontpage’, a tool to create websites, which was all it took to set the cogs in motion. So, I created my first website on <span class="text--blue">‘India’ </span>, which had troves of information on the cultural diversity of India. It garnered over a thousand hits within the first month. It was at this golden moment, I vowed to myself that I needed to be an integral part of the information revolution sweeping the world. I set myself on a path that would lead me to the world of computers. After my 10th grade, I enrolled for a three year diploma in Computer Science. I then went on to obtain my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Technology at the University of Pune. <span class="text--blue">And I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.</span> </p></span></h2>

                <p class="body">In 2013, a person from <a class="body-link" href="https://www.persistent.com" target="_blank">Persistent Systems</a> visited our college and asked our Head of the Department a list of students who she thought excelled in class. Obviously my name was not in the list and I thought this was not fair. So I wrote an email to one of the HRs at Persistent Systems saying even I'd like an opportunity to work with the company and so the folks at Persistent Systems gladly invited to test our skill sets. Me along with my team mates were able to crack the test and were offered an year long project.</p>

                <blockquote class="citation">
                    <p class="citation__wrapper">There were four of us collaborating in different capacities, and at no point was anyone&nbsp;territorial.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="body mar-bot-short">So I contacted the team and spoke with his manager at persistent Systems and started working on the project that was assigned to us. The project was to <span class="text--orange">Develop a Platform Independent Test Automation Framework using Selenium, Java and TestNG.</span>"There were four of us collaborating in different capacities, and at no point was anyone territorial." What started as a just an email side project quickly became our full-time jobs later on as we were working day and night during the last six months of the college just on the project.</p>
                <p class="body">The main function of the software was to automate the test cases using the input values given to the software in the form of an XML file or Excel data sheets.</p>
                <p class="body">The software then automated the tests that were to be carried out from the test cases specified. This project helped the company save about $7000 in license costs.</p>

                    <p class="body body--shorter">So, what do you do just after having finished working for one of the biggest MNCs in India. Well thats a tough question because the way these companies work is totally different from how any other software company might work, because the scale is very different. So I now wanted to work for a start-up and gain some more experience. </p>
                    <p class="body">Luckily I knew just the right place to look for. My father's friend had just incubated this Software Start-up which is an E-Learning software company <a class="body-link" href="http://www.smartlearning.in/login.php" target="_blank">Smart Learning Pvt Ltd.</a> So I started working with them on this great project where they were integrating the software with these cool animated videos that they made in-house for the software. I played a leadership role in the integration part of those videos with the software module.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body">I learned a lot of things during that process and this made me realize that the kind of experiences you get by working with an MNC are totally different from that of a start-up. In a start-up its all about the company and the team work and how you get it done quickly without there being any delay in the process.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="body">After this work was done I then took a few months off as I went back to school. I started with my master's program. Then I went back to India during the Summer of 2015 as I was not allowed to do an internship in the US due a few rules imposed on Spring admit students. But since I was in India I got in touch with my college friend who has started his own software company <a class="body-link" href="http://themagnum.in/m/" target="_blank">Magnum Technologies</a> and had been floating it successfully since two years. So I started working with him at his office as an Associate Web Apps Developer. The team only consisted of a total of eight members back then, but it was great ! </p>

                </blockquote>


                <p class="body">I quickly became a part of the core team members and even before I knew I wasn't just a developer in the company, but was also responsible for getting clients. And because I was able to get clients I was able to better understand their needs and develop apps and deliver serivces to their needs.</p>

                <p class="body mar-bot-none">But to get the exact same code to run in the browser as on the server, which this implementation of real-time collaboration required, meant they needed to rewrite some of the core code running Google's actual servers.

                <p class="body body--closer">And so with a working prototype, the team brought it to the group’s director for a live demo. "I remember the first time our director and manager were testing it out and editing the same doc at the same time. They started making fun of each other in the doc, deleting each other's edits, writing jokes and insults and I'm there sweating bullets worried that something would break!"</p>
                <p class="body">It didn't break, and the real-time collaboration engine the team built was generalized and now powers similar functionality not only in Docs, but in Google's entire Apps suite as well as countless apps from third-party developers using the <a class="body-link" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime/overview" target="_blank">Google Drive Realtime API</a>.</p>
                <p class="body">Since launching, millions of users have collaborated in Docs on book reports, wedding vows, movie scripts, and more. The Google team has added the ability to work on documents offline and then have edits re-sync when you’re back online. And now people can collaborate on the same doc at the same time from desktops, tablets, and phones.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p class="body">But there are still lots of tough problems that require new solutions. Like, how do you allow for collaborative editing of <a class="body-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_blank">directed acyclic graphs</a> without leaving a lot of garbage in the model? How can you reorder file trees while users are accessing content? Or what about managing multi-user interactions on complex objects, like HTML tables? "There are so many unsolved challenges. We’ve still got so much work to do."</p>
